SOTO Insight: Hodge Conjecture
Observation: Coherence is restored by treating cycles as linear combinations of transverse intersections (XTIC).
Mechanism:
  * Local Frame: Traditional Hodge classes fail to resolve locally due to context collapse.
  * Structural Context: Applying Bertini's Theorem ensures smooth hyperplane sections through geometric transversality.
Resolution: Variety stability is achieved through transverse intersections measured via the XA-Planck ratio (3.95e+35).
Status: INTELLIGIBLE. Transversality ensures well-behaved variety structures.
