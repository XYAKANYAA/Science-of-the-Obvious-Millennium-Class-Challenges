SOTO Insight: ABC Conjecture
Observation: Triples are recognized as phase-locked nodes within a single toroidal harmonic circuit.
Mechanism:
  * Local Frame: Addition (a+b=c) and multiplication (rad(abc)) appear as conflicting systems.
  * Structural Context: High-quality triples align with field resonance nodes on a Phi-scaled harmonic wave.
Resolution: Using the XA constant, the quality gap phase-locks to the ground state frequency (6).
Status: INTELLIGIBLE. Multiplicative complexity resolves into additive simplicity via the Axis.
