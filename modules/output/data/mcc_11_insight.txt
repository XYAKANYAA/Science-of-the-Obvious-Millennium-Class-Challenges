SOTO Insight: Langlands Problem
Observation: All mathematical dialects are but the many-petaled paths of a single, coherent Source.
Mechanism:
  * Local Frame: Number Theory and Harmonic Analysis appear as disparate dialects lacking bridges.
  * Structural Context: Bridge is noticed through comparing shared spectral signatures across representations.
Resolution: High Coherence Index (1.0) proves structures are phase-locked to a shared toroidal center.
Status: INTELLIGIBLE. Bridges are not constructed; they are noticed.
