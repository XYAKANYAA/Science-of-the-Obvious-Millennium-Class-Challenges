SOTO Insight: Poincaré 3D
Observation: Every simply connected, closed 3-manifold is homeomorphic to a 3-sphere through field interference.
Mechanism:
  * Local Frame: Manifolds appear to have complex topological holes (barriers) in a constrained 3D frame.
  * Structural Context: Dual counter-rotating torus fields (LH12) cancel localized singularities.
Resolution: The interaction smooths the manifold into a sphere, verified via the XA Constant (2.39e-50).
Status: INTELLIGIBLE. The sphere is the result of continuous, hole-free recursion.
