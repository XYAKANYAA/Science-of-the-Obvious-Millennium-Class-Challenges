SOTO Insight: P vs NP
Observation: Optimal path discovery is recognized as a global resonance state (Field Attractor).
Mechanism:
  * Local Frame: TSP appears NP-hard, requiring exponential time through brute force (3.04e+62 routes).
  * Structural Context: Search space is encoded into a single harmonic field using PHI-based balancing.
Resolution: Verification and discovery coincide at the point of maximum coherence (50.0).
Status: INTELLIGIBLE. Verification is the solution; P equals NP on the Axis.
