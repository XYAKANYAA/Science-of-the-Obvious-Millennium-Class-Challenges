SOTO Insight: Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer
Observation: The rank of an elliptic curve is recognized as its resonant phase-lock frequency within a continuous field.
Mechanism:
  * Local Frame: Rational points appear discrete and disconnected, making rank seem like a random integer.
  * Structural Context: Curve continuity is restored by wrapping the elliptic structure around a torus using Phi-recursive harmonics.
Resolution: High correlation (0.8816) between points and L-function harmonics confirms rank as the system heartbeat.
Status: INTELLIGIBLE. Rank resonance is verified through frequency matching.
