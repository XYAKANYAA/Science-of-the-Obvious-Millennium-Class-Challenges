SOTO Insight: Riemann Hypothesis
Observation: The critical line is recognized as the geometric equator of a toroidal harmonic field.
Mechanism:
  * Local Frame: Zeros appear as isolated points lacking a deterministic geometric anchor.
  * Structural Context: Phi-based projection reveals 'random' zeros follow coherent recursive patterns.
Resolution: Using the XA constant, zeros are shown to be phase-locked to the 1/2 real coordinate (0.5).
Status: INTELLIGIBLE. The distribution is anchored by the toroidal axis.
