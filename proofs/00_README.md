# XYAKANYAA Proof Suite
## Guide to Contextual Analysis of Millennium-Class Challenges

---

## Purpose of This Folder

The documents in this folder are **contextual analyses**, not traditional mathematical proofs.

They are intended to document what changes when historically difficult problems are examined from an expanded observational frame—one that includes the structural context that generates the behavior being studied.

Each document records:
- What appears paradoxical from a locally constrained frame
- What additional structure becomes visible when context is expanded
- How the apparent paradox changes or dissolves under that expansion
- Where and how the approach can fail

No institutional authority is claimed.  
No final resolution is asserted.  
Inspection, refutation, and comparison are explicitly invited.

## How These Documents Are Structured

All 11 analyses follow the **same structure** so they can be compared directly.

### 1. Missing Context
Each document begins by identifying the **observational limitation** that gives rise to the apparent problem. This section frames the analysis and clarifies what is—and is not—being claimed.

### 2. Classical Formulation
The standard statement of the problem is presented, along with a plain-language explanation and a brief account of why existing approaches encounter obstruction.

This section grounds the analysis in the established literature.

### 3. Contextual Expansion (Levels 3 → 4 → 5)

The core of each document is a three-level examination:

- **Level 3 — Local Frame Analysis**  
  What is visible when the problem is examined from a constrained, local frame.

- **Level 4 — Structural Pattern Recognition**  
  What becomes visible when recursive or global structure is included.

- **Level 5 — Stabilized Description**  
  How the apparent paradox changes when both local behavior and generating structure are held simultaneously.

These levels describe **perspective shifts**, not physical dimensions.

### 4. Falsifiability
Each analysis explicitly states the conditions under which it would fail.

This includes:
- Experimental contradiction
- Computational inconsistency
- Logical or mathematical breakdown
- Superior alternative explanations

If these conditions are met, the analysis should be considered invalid.

### 5. References
Relevant sources are listed to situate the analysis within existing work and to enable independent verification.

## How to Use This Proof Suite

Different readers may approach these documents with different goals. All are valid.

### Path 1: Code-First Verification
For readers primarily interested in reproducibility.

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the corresponding code module in `modules/`
3. Examine generated outputs in `data/`, `validation/`, and `visuals/`
4. Compare results to the values discussed in the analysis

### Path 2: Proof-First Review
For readers focused on logical and mathematical structure.

1. Read the analysis document in this folder
2. Follow the contextual expansion step by step
3. Examine derivations and representations
4. Review falsifiability conditions
5. Run code only if desired for confirmation

### Path 3: Framework-First Understanding
For readers new to the methodology.

1. Read *The Axis* (conceptual orientation)
2. Review `geometry/FRAMEWORK.md` (representational structures)
3. Return here and read Module 01
4. Proceed to additional modules as needed

## Representational Geometry

Geometric language (e.g., phi recursion, toroidal structure) is used **as representation**, not as literal ontology.

These representations are tools for tracking coherence, recursion, and scale—not claims about what reality “is.”

If a representation fails to clarify or generalize, it should be discarded.

---

## Relationship to the Code

The analyses in this folder are **paired** with executable code in the `modules/` directory.

- The documents explain *what is being examined and why*
- The code demonstrates *what happens when the analysis is instantiated*

Neither replaces the other.  
Both are necessary for full inspection.

---

## Scope and Limits

These documents:
- Do not claim completeness
- Do not replace traditional mathematical methods
- Do not assert inevitability or finality
- Do not require belief

They are best understood as **research notes made public**.

---

## Navigating the Modules

Begin with **Module 01 (Yang–Mills)**, which serves as the template for all others.

Subsequent modules follow the same structure and can be read independently, though familiarity with earlier modules may provide helpful context.

---

*These documents record what was observed from a particular orientation.  
Whether the observations hold is an open question.*
