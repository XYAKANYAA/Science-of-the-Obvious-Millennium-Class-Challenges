# Module 10: ABC Conjecture
## Contextual Analysis Using the Axis Framework

---

## The Missing Context

When integer relationships are tracked locally (prime-by-prime) without a stabilized global measure of “structure vs size,” the inequality appears mysterious. The conjecture sits where local factorization must be held alongside global growth constraints.

---

## Classical Formulation

### Formal Statement (Standard Form)

For coprime positive integers a, b, c with a + b = c, define rad(abc) as the product of distinct primes dividing abc. The conjecture states that c is rarely much larger than rad(abc)^(1+ε) for any ε>0.

### Plain-Language Description

If a + b = c, the conjecture says c usually can’t be enormous without abc containing many small prime factors.

### Historical Difficulty

1. **Radical vs magnitude:** linking distinct prime factors to size bounds is deep.  
2. **Rare exceptions:** the statement is about distribution, not a single bound.  
3. **Frame limitation:** local prime accounting does not automatically encode global rarity.

## Contextual Expansion (Three-Level Analysis)

### Level 3 — Local Frame Analysis

**Observed Behavior**

Individual triples can look exceptional; global constraints are hard to formalize.

**Computational Verification**

Level 4 — Structural Pattern Recognition
Expanded Context
Representational recursion can model how “distinctness” of prime factors constrains scale growth, producing a stabilizing relationship between structure (rad) and magnitude (c).

Level 5 — Stabilized Description
Context Stabilization
A stabilized frame encodes growth constraints across scale rather than treating factorization and magnitude as separate.

Falsifiability
This analysis fails if:
It predicts bounds contradicted by known high-quality abc triples.
Code results cannot be reproduced.
The representation cannot distinguish ordinary vs exceptional triples.
The framework conflicts with known implications (e.g., consequences for Diophantine equations) without explanation.

The conjecture becomes legible when “structure” and “size” are held in one stabilized frame.
