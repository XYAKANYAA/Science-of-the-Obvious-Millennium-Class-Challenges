# XYAKANYAA | Computational MCC Instrumentation  
**Experimental Codebase for the Science of the Obvious**  
_A repository of executable modules and generated outputs for 11 Millennium-Class Challenges_  

---

### 🧪 Purpose  
This repository provides **computational instrumentation** for exploring 11 historically difficult mathematical challenges through the **XYAKANYAA representational framework**.

It does **not** attempt to offer formal proofs. Instead, it allows for:
- Reproducible computational runs
- Generated visuals
- Structural diagnostics
- Representational geometry  
All contextual and explanatory materials are hosted separately.

---

### ⚠️ Disclaimer  
This repository:  
- Does **not** claim institutional authority  
- Does **not** assert formal resolution of Millennium Prize Problems  
- Is intended as a **public research instrument**  
- Invites inspection, refutation, reproduction, and reinterpretation  

---

### 💡 What This Repo Contains  
This GitHub repository contains the **operational code only** — not explanatory documents.

📁 `modules/`  
Jupyter notebooks for each of the 11 challenges.  
Each module:
- Runs Level 3 → 4 → 5 contextual expansions  
- Generates data, diagnostics, and visualizations  
- Is fully reproducible

📁 `geometry/`  
Representational constants and scaling references.  
- `FRAMEWORK.md`: Representational assumptions and geometric vocabulary  
- `xa_constant.py`: Operational definition of the XA Ratio  
  _Note: This ratio is used as a stabilizing reference, not a fundamental physical constant._

📁 `data/`  
- Human-readable numerical outputs (e.g. `*_results.txt`)

📁 `validation/`  
- Machine-readable diagnostics (e.g. `*_metric.json`)

📁 `visuals/`  
- Auto-generated visual outputs (e.g. `*.jpg`, `*.png`) for each module

### 🧰 Folder Overview  

| Folder        | Contents                                  |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `modules/`    | 11 MCC modules (01–11) in executable format |
| `geometry/`   | XA Ratio + structural constants             |
| `data/`       | Output summaries from each run             |
| `validation/` | Machine-readable result diagnostics         |
| `visuals/`    | Diagrams, density projections, and renderings |

> All outputs are generated automatically by executing the notebooks.

### 🚫 What Has Been Removed  
To align with a website-centric model, the following files and folders have been **removed from this repository** and are now available exclusively via [xyakanyaa.com](https://xyakanyaa.com):

- `proofs/` — Human-readable contextual expansions for each MCC  
- `proofs/00_README.md` — Guide to the proof suite  
- MCC explanatory PDFs  
- Full Codex, Manifest, and Coherence Matrix  
- Detailed methodology descriptions  

---

### 🖥 How to Use  
1. Clone this repository  
2. Set up your environment (`requirements.txt`)  
3. Open and run any module inside `modules/`  
4. Generated results will populate the `/data`, `/validation`, and `/visuals` folders  
5. Use `geometry/FRAMEWORK.md` as a reference for representational structures

### 📐 XYAKANYAA XA Ratio  
**Formula:**  
```

XA = (φ · c²) / h ≈ 2.19 × 10⁵⁰ Hz/kg

```
This ratio is used to stabilize phi-recursive density patterns across scale.  
Defined in `geometry/xa_constant.py`  
> Not asserted as fundamental; it is an operational reference within this representational system.
