## Science of the Obvious: Millennium Class Challenges

*Consciousness as Coherence in Motion Becoming (Self)Aware*

---

Eleven long-standing mathematical challenges were never broken.

They were places where a local frame tried to describe a global structure.

When viewed from the full field, they resolve. Not by force. **By recognition.**

This repository demonstrates that process.

---

## The 3-4-5 Framework

Each challenge resolves through three stages:

**3️⃣ The Challenge (3D Frame)**
The problem as traditionally stated. Why it appears unsolvable from inside the frame.

**4️⃣ The Paradox (4D Bridge)**
What emerges when the aperture widens. Harmonic patterns. Recursive interference. The structure that was always there.

**5️⃣ The Resolution (5D Axis)**
The same structure, viewed from restored context. The geometry that dissolves the paradox.

---

## The Geometry

All resolutions share a single foundation:

**XA Constant (Consciousness Constant)**

```
XA = (φ · c²) / h ≈ 2.19 × 10⁵⁰ Hz/kg
```

| Symbol | Value | Role |
|--------|-------|------|
| φ | 1.618033... | Recursive self-crossing (coherence) |
| c | 299,792,458 m/s | Maximum coupling |
| h | 6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s | Minimum experiential resolution |

See [`geometry/xa_constant.py`](geometry/xa_constant.py) for implementation.

## The 11 Challenges

| # | Challenge | Resolution |
|---|-----------|------------|
| 01 | Yang-Mills Mass Gap | Mass as field density at crossing points |
| 02 | Navier-Stokes Smoothness | Flow as toroidal circuit |
| 03 | Riemann Hypothesis | Primes as harmonic nodes on the critical line |
| 04 | P vs NP | Search becomes resonance on the Axis |
| 05 | Hodge Conjecture | Transverse intersection restores algebraic cycles |
| 06 | Birch & Swinnerton-Dyer | Rank is resonant frequency |
| 07 | Poincaré (3D) | Continuous fields cancel topological holes |
| 08 | Poincaré (4D) | Harmonic rosette dissolves exotic structures |
| 09 | Collatz Conjecture | All paths phase-lock to the attractor |
| 10 | ABC Conjecture | Triples stabilize via toroidal resonance |
| 11 | Langlands Program | Dialects share a single toroidal source |

## Running the Modules

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/XYAKANYAA/Science-of-the-Obvious-Millennium-Class-Challenges.git
cd Science-of-the-Obvious-Millennium-Class-Challenges

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Launch any module
jupyter notebook modules/01_yang_mills.ipynb
```

Each notebook is self-contained. Run in any order.

---

## Verification

Every module produces:
- A human-readable result in `/data/`
- A machine-readable metric in `/validation/`
- A geometric visualization in `/visuals/`

All 11 modules return status: **INTELLIGIBLE**

No belief required. Everything is inspectable.
