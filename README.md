# XYAKANYAA Contextual Analysis Suite

**Experimental Examination of 11 Millennium-Class Mathematical Challenges**

## Disclaimer

This repository does **not** claim institutional authority or formal proof of any Millennium Prize Problem.  
It documents an experimental, inspectable approach to contextual analysis.

All results are open to:
- verification
- refutation
- correction
- reinterpretation

This work is a **research instrument**, not a closed system.

## What This Is

This repository contains **11 contextual analyses** examining what changes when historically difficult mathematical problems are approached from an expanded observational frame.

**These are not formal proofs in the traditional sense.**  
They are:

- observational reports  
- methodological documentation  
- falsifiable analyses  
- reproducible computational examinations  

Each analysis pairs:
- a **written contextual examination** (`/proofs`)
- a **computational instrument** (`/modules`)
- machine-readable diagnostics (`/validation`)
- geometric visualizations (`/visuals`)

---

## Structural Method (3-4-5 Framework)

Each challenge is examined through the same lens:

1. **Missing Context**  
   What observational limitation creates the apparent paradox?

2. **Classical Formulation**  
   The standard statement and historical difficulty.

3. **Contextual Expansion**
   - **Level 3** — Local frame analysis  
   - **Level 4** — Structural pattern recognition  
   - **Level 5** — Stabilized description  

4. **Falsifiability**  
   Explicit conditions under which the analysis fails.

5. **References**  
   Comparative and historical grounding.

## Shared Methodology

All analyses share the same operational components:

### 1. Phi-Recursive Representation
Structures are tracked using φ-based recursive mirroring rather than circular closure.

### 2. XYAKANYAA XA Ratio (Operational Reference)

XA = (φ · c²) / h ≈ 2.19 × 10⁵⁰ Hz/kg

- Used as a **scaling and stabilization reference**
- Not asserted as a fundamental physical constant

Implementation:  
[`geometry/xa_constant.py`](geometry/xa_constant.py)

### 3. Contextual Expansion
Framework derived from *The Axis* (see Related Work).

### 4. Falsifiability
Each module explicitly documents failure conditions.

## How to Use This Repository

### For Verification
1. Read the analysis in `/proofs`
2. Run the corresponding notebook in `/modules`
3. Compare outputs in `/data` and `/validation`
4. Review falsifiability notes

### For Review
1. Examine the classical formulation
2. Follow the 3 → 4 → 5 expansion
3. Inspect computations
4. Challenge assumptions

## Verification Status

- **Module 01 (Yang–Mills):**  
  Computational output (1704.14 MeV) aligns with an established experimental benchmark  
  (f₀ glueball: 1704 ± 12 MeV).

- **Modules 02–11:**  
  No direct experimental benchmark exists.  
  Validation is therefore:
  - structural
  - computational
  - comparative
  - falsifiable

All modules return status: **INTELLIGIBLE**

---

## Limitations

This work:
- is experimental
- may contain errors
- does not replace traditional proofs
- should be evaluated on reproducibility, not authority

Contradictions and failures are welcomed and should be documented.
