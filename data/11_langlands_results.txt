Module 11 — Langlands Program (Spectral Correspondence Diagnostic)

Spectral coherence index: 1.000000

Observations:
- Two representational dialects exhibit near-identical spectral fingerprints
- Correspondence arises through shared structure, not translation
- Alignment is diagnostic, not a formal proof

Notes:
- This module does not claim resolution of the Langlands Program
- It demonstrates contextual recognition via spectral invariants
