Module 02 — Navier–Stokes Contextual Analysis

Local gradient proxy (finite): 9.983308

Model signal:
Peak energy transient: 0.589341
RMS energy: 0.187790

XYAKANYAA XA Ratio used: 2.194689e+50 Hz/kg
Operational stability index: 1.06e-17
Threshold: 1.0e-10
Bounded under model: True

Observation:
Under this phi-scaled damping representation, the modeled transient remains bounded.
This module is diagnostic and does not constitute a full PDE existence/smoothness proof.
