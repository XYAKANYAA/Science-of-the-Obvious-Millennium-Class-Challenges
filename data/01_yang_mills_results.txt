Module 01 — Yang–Mills Contextual Analysis

Experimental benchmark:
  f₀ glueball mass = 1704.14 MeV/c²

Structural density relation:
  π√3 / φ multiplier = 3.3630

φ-recursive density mass:
  5730.97 MeV/c²

Observation:
The Yang–Mills mass gap corresponds to a density transition
between circular (π-closed) and recursive (φ-crossing) representations.

φ does not generate the mass scale.
It explains the density relationship between observed scales.
