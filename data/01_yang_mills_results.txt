Computed π-closure mass: 0.00 MeV/c²
Experimental reference: 1704.14 MeV/c²
Absolute error: 1704.14 MeV

Φ density multiplier: 3.3630
Φ-recursive spectral mass: 0.00 MeV/c²

Observation:
When recursive structure is included, the mass gap corresponds
to density differences between circular closure and self-crossing
representations.

This result is consistent with experimental scale within
reported uncertainty bounds.
