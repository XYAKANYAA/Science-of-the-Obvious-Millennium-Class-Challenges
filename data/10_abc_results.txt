Module 10 — ABC (Coherence Ratio Diagnostic)

Triple: 1 + 8 = 9
rad(abc): 6
ABC quality q: 1.226294

Interference diagnostics (representational):
peak: 2.558220
trough: -2.557079
rms: 1.253054
std: 1.244025

Operational coherence score: 0.562843
Quality threshold: 1.40
High quality under threshold: False

Notes:
- This module does not prove the ABC conjecture.
- It reports standard ABC diagnostics (radical, quality) and a representational interference model.
